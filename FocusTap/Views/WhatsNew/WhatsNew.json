    "description": "After reviewing Apple's documentation, it appears that the system can only support blocking up to 50 apps and 50 categories—beyond that, the blocking feature ceases to function. To help users manage this limitation, I've added counters to the 'Configure Blocked Apps' page, making it easier to track the number of selected apps and categories."
